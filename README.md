A typing test is designed to find how fast one types in a given amount of time. We will be designing a typing game using JavaScript that presents a simple typing challenge and finds the performance of typing by calculating the Characters Per Minute (CPM), Words Per Minute (WPM) and the accuracy of the typed characters.
The game shows a series of quotes that have to be typed in a specified time limit, as fast as possible. A higher typing speed would show a higher WPM value. Incorrectly typed characters would be marked accordingly during typing.
We will create the HTML layout first, style it using CSS and then write the logic in JavaScript. 
The HTML Layout: The HTML layout defines the element structure that would be shown on the page. This includes:
 

Header Portion: This section shows the statistics of the current typing session. This includes the display of the time left, number of errors, accuracy, WPM and CPM.
Quote Section: This section shows the current text that has to be typed in the input area.
Input Area: This section contains the input area where the text has to be typed.
Restart Button: This is the restart button which would be shown once the time runs out and the game finishes.
